# @syntara/audit

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 320a45c: Phase 5: the drift auditor, the MCP server and brand fidelity (ADR-018, ADR-022).

  - audit: new package. `syntara-audit <path>` finds raw colours, off-scale sizes, written-out fonts, native elements, physical properties, missing accessible names and deprecated APIs. It scores 0–100, suggests a fix for every finding, and `--fix` applies the ones with a single right answer.
  - mcp: new package. A read-only MCP server with seven tools: `list_components`, `get_component`, `get_example`, `get_tokens`, `find_token`, `get_pattern` and `audit_snippet`. It serves `AGENTS.md` and `GOVERNANCE.md` as resources.
  - theme-engine: `brandFidelity(theme)` reports how far each brand fill is from the colour the brand asked for.
  - tokens: each tenant's `contrast-report.json` includes brand fidelity.

### Patch Changes

- Packaging for the first release.

  - Every package carries its own `LICENSE` (npm does not hoist a monorepo root one), `repository` with its
    `directory`, `homepage`, `bugs` and `keywords`, so npm can show a source link and the packages are findable.
  - `@syntara/react`, `@syntara/icons` and `@syntara/theme-engine` have READMEs, which are what npm renders as the
    package page.
  - `@syntara/icons` and `@syntara/theme-engine` are built packages rather than TypeScript source: ESM with
    `preserveModules` plus declarations, mapped through `publishConfig.exports`. They previously exported
    `./src/index.ts`, which Node cannot load and Next.js will not transpile without `transpilePackages`. Neither
    declared `files`, so npm had also been packing their test suites — 2 files and 14 respectively, including the
    native token snapshots; both now ship `dist` alone.
  - `@syntara/react` and `@syntara/tokens` build on `prepack`, so a tarball can no longer ship a stale `dist`.
  - `@syntara/sdui`'s peer ranges on `@syntara/react` and `@syntara/icons` are real ranges instead of `workspace:*`,
    which publishes as an exact pin and would make every later release a peer conflict.
